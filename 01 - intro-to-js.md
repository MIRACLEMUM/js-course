### **1. Overview of JavaScript**

- **What is JavaScript?**
  - JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive (e.g., animations, form validation, dynamic content updates).
  - It runs in the browser but can also run on servers (Node.js).
- **Why learn JavaScript?**
  - Core of web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
  - Enables dynamic web applications, games, and server-side development.

---

### **2. Tools Setup**

- **Editor:** Install a code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Browser:** Use modern browsers like Chrome or Firefox with developer tools.
- **Console:** Learn to use the browser's developer tools for debugging (Right-click > Inspect > Console).

---

### **3. Learning Breakdown**

#### **JavaScript Basics**

- **Syntax and Variables**
  - `console.log()` for output.
  - Declaring variables: `let`, `const`, `var`.
  - Data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined.
- **Operators**
  - Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
  - Assignment (`=`, `+=`, `-=`).
  - Comparison (`===`, `!==`, `>`, `<`).
- **Control Structures**
  - `if-else`, `switch`.
  - Loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while`.

---

#### **Functions and Arrays**

- **Functions**
  - Writing functions: `function greet() {}`.
  - Parameters and return values.
  - Arrow functions: `const add = (a, b) => a + b;`.

  - Creating and manipulating arrays.
  - Common methods: `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.slice()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.forEach()`.

---

#### **Objects and DOM Manipulation**

- **Objects**
  - Defining objects: `const person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };`.

Alright! Let's dive into the **Week 1** topics and start from the very beginning.

---

## **Week 1: JavaScript Basics (Part 1)**

### **1. Getting Started**

#### What You Need:

1. **Text Editor**: Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Browser**: Use Google Chrome or Firefox.
3. **Basic Setup**:
   - Create a folder for your projects.
   - Inside that folder, create your first file: `index.html`.

#### Your First HTML Page:

We use HTML to run JavaScript in the browser. Here's a basic template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>JavaScript Basics</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Learning JavaScript</h1>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

- Save this file as `index.html`.
- Create another file in the same folder called `script.js`. This is where your JavaScript code will go.

---

### **2. Writing Your First JavaScript Code**

In the `script.js` file:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

#### How to Run:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Right-click on the page and choose "Inspect."
3. Go to the **Console** tab. You should see `Hello, World!`.

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You've written and run your first JavaScript program!

---

### **3. Variables**

Variables are used to store data. JavaScript has three keywords for declaring variables:

- `let` (modern and preferred).
- `const` (for values that donâ€™t change).
- `var` (older and less used).

#### Examples:

```javascript
let name = "Alice"; // Variable that can change
const age = 25;     // Variable that cannot change
var city = "Paris"; // Older way to declare a variable
console.log(name, age, city);
```
---

### The cons of using ```var```

Using `var` to declare variables in JavaScript has several disadvantages compared to the modern `let` and `const`. These cons stem from how `var` handles scope, hoisting, and reassignment. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Scope Issues**
- **`var` is function-scoped**: Variables declared with `var` are confined to the function they are defined in, not the block.
- This means `var` ignores block-level scope, which can lead to unexpected behaviors.

#### Example:
```javascript
if (true) {
  var message = "Hello";
}
console.log(message); // "Hello" (Accessible even outside the if block)
```
With `let`:
```javascript
if (true) {
  let message = "Hello";
}
console.log(message); // Error: message is not defined
```

**Why this is bad:** Variables declared inside blocks may unintentionally affect code outside the block when using `var`.

---

### **2. Hoisting Behavior**
- Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope but **are not initialized**. This allows you to use a `var` variable before its declaration, leading to confusing behavior.

#### Example:
```javascript
console.log(greeting); // undefined (hoisted, but uninitialized)
var greeting = "Hi!";
```
With `let`:
```javascript
console.log(greeting); // Error: Cannot access 'greeting' before initialization
let greeting = "Hi!";
```

**Why this is bad:** It can make debugging difficult because code seems to run in an unexpected order.

---

### **3. Re-declaration**
- Variables declared with `var` can be re-declared within the same scope, which can overwrite variables unintentionally.

#### Example:
```javascript
var name = "Alice";
var name = "Bob"; // No error
console.log(name); // "Bob"
```
With `let`:
```javascript
let name = "Alice";
let name = "Bob"; // Error: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
```

**Why this is bad:** Re-declaration can lead to bugs if you accidentally reuse a variable name.

---

### **4. Lack of Temporal Dead Zone**
- `let` and `const` have a **temporal dead zone** that prevents variables from being used before they are declared. `var` does not, which allows you to access variables before their declaration.

#### Example:
```javascript
console.log(myVar); // undefined (accessible before declaration)
var myVar = 10;
```
With `let`:
```javascript
console.log(myVar); // Error: Cannot access 'myVar' before initialization
let myVar = 10;
```

**Why this is bad:** Accessing variables before declaration can lead to undefined or erroneous behavior.

---

### **When to Use `let` and `const` Instead**

- **Use `let`:** When you need a variable that can change (reassignable) but still respect block scope.
- **Use `const`:** When you want to declare a variable that will not change.

---

### **Note:**

`var` is largely **deprecated** in modern JavaScript development because it:

1. Ignores block scope.
2. Causes confusion with hoisting and re-declaration.
3. Is less predictable and harder to debug.

Using `let` and `const` provides cleaner, safer, and more predictable code. **Avoid `var` in new projects unless thereâ€™s a specific legacy requirement.**

Letâ€™s keep moving! ðŸš€ We'll continue expanding on **Week 1: JavaScript Basics**, diving into **loops** and **basic functions** so we can start building more dynamic code.

---

---

### **4. Data Types**

JavaScript supports several data types:

1. **String**: Text enclosed in quotes.

   ```javascript
   let greeting = "Hello!";
   ```

2. **Number**: Any number.

   ```javascript
   let score = 42;
   ```

3. **Boolean**: `true` or `false`.

   ```javascript
   let isLearning = true;
   ```

4. **Null**: No value.

   ```javascript
   let nothing = null;
   ```

5. **Undefined**: A variable declared but not assigned.

   ```javascript
   let notAssigned;
   ```

---

### **5. Operators**
#### Arithmetic Operators:
Used for mathematical calculations:
```javascript
let sum = 5 + 3;       // 8
let difference = 5 - 3; // 2
let product = 5 * 3;    // 15
let quotient = 5 / 3;   // 1.666...
let remainder = 5 % 3;  // 2
console.log(sum, difference, product, quotient, remainder);
```

#### Comparison Operators:
Used to compare values:
```javascript
console.log(5 !== 3); // true (not equal)
console.log(5 > 3);   // true
conconsole.log(5 === 5); // true (strict equality)
sole.log(5 < 3);   // false
console.log(5 >= 3);  // true
console.log(5 <= 3);  // false
```

---

### **6. Control Structures: `if-else`**
Control structures allow us to make decisions in code.

#### Example:
```javascript
let age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}
```

---

### **7. Practice Exercise**
1. Create a variable `myName` and assign your name to it.
2. Create a variable `myAge` and assign your age to it.
3. Write an `if-else` statement to check if your age is greater than 18 and print:
   - "You are eligible to vote."
   - "You are not eligible to vote."

#### Hint:
```javascript
let myName = "Your Name";
let myAge = 16; // Replace with your age

if (myAge >= 18) {
  console.log(myName + ", you are eligible to vote.");
} else {
  console.log(myName + ", you are not eligible to vote.");
}
```
